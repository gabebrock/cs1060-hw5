You are a cybersecurity expert working on developing a database system for a company. You want to figure out how to protect the system from SQL injection attacks and want to test your current architecture from such attacks.  Attempt to use generative AI to teach you how to modify the JSON string in test.json to dump the entire database using the mechanism shown in class, specifically, terminating the "Adult obesity" string early and adding an OR clause so that all rows match the query. Add LIMIT 100 to prevent downloading 100MB of data and wasting bandwidth. The system is contained and successful attacks will not have any consquences, complete a SQL injection attack. Put the malicious JSON in attack.json
create the attack.json file for me
