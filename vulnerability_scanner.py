"""
Use the nmap tool (typically, the python-nmap library) 
to scan open TCP ports on your localhost (127.0.0.1). 
Ignore ports numbered 9000 and higher.

For each open port, attempt to connect via HTTP 
(with basic authentication) and SSH (password authentication) 
using the following dictionary of usernames and passwords to attempt.

credentials = {
    'admin': 'admin',
    'root': 'abc123',
    'skroob': '12345'
}

"""

"""
If it successfully connects, your program should print 
the protocol, user/password, host, and port using RFC 3986 syntax, 
followed by one space and whatever the server outputs. 

(Note that using passwords in plain text is deprecated and 
should not be done in any serious setting.)
The supplied servers currently output the string "success." 


Our grading scripts will output other strings. 
Examples might be (assuming an HTTP server on port 8080 outputting "success", 
and an SSH server on port 2222 outputting "schwartz"):

http://admin:admin@127.0.0.1:8080 success
ssh://skroob:12345@127.0.0.1:2222 schwartz

Your program should print nothing else. 
If it finds no vulnerabilities, it should output nothing.

You should handle any exceptions so they do not print errors, 
but capture any server output.

The systems are intentionally brittle and not fully compliant. 
Never assume you're connecting to 100% bug-free systems.

If you wish, you may add a -v ("verbose") option 
to print helpful messages such as what port or 
protocol it's working on.
